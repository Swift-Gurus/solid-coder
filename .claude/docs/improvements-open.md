# Open Improvement Suggestions

Suggestions that have not been implemented, need investigation, need POC validation, or are planned for the future.

Large architectural items (S-26, S-32, S-33, S-42, S-43, S-44) are in [@docs/improvements-open-arch.md](improvements-open-arch.md).

## S-05: Add post-synthesis verification script

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Category**: Reliability

**Status**: Deferred — scalability concern, iterative re-review is preferred

Phase 4 of synthesize-fixes asks the LLM to simulate other principles' metrics on proposed code. This is the weakest point — the LLM is likely to rubber-stamp its own output with `"passed": true`.

### Why deferred

Per-principle verification scripts don't scale. Each new rule (DIP, DRY, etc.) requires its own script with custom proxy checks (grep patterns, count heuristics) that are brittle and produce false positives/negatives. Maintenance burden grows linearly with rule count.

The iterative re-review approach (S-04) is the scalable alternative — after implementation, the same review agents re-check the changed files against all principles. This is principle-agnostic and reuses existing infrastructure rather than adding parallel validation scripts.

## S-09: Detect oscillation in iteration loop

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Category**: Reliability

**Status**: Not implemented — low practical risk

If iteration 1 fixes issue A but introduces issue B, and iteration 2 fixes B but reintroduces A-like patterns, the loop oscillates without converging. In practice, the pipeline follows patterns properly and oscillation hasn't been observed. The real risk is when a fix modifies a caller site, which then gets re-reviewed in the next iteration and flagged for unrelated violations — this is more of a scoping problem (S-04) than oscillation.

**Suggestion**: In Phase 8 (Iteration Loop), before re-reviewing:

1. Compare finding IDs from iteration N vs iteration N-1. If >50% overlap → flag oscillation
2. Diff the source files against their pre-iteration-1 state. If net change is small (<10 lines divergence from original) → the iterations are undoing each other
3. If oscillation detected → stop, report both iterations' findings, let the developer decide

Also: log per-iteration finding IDs in the refactor-log.json so oscillation is visible in the output.

## S-10: Add output cleanup mechanism

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low | **Category**: Maintenance

`.solid_coder/` grows with every run. Timestamped directories accumulate without bounds.

**Suggestion**: Options (pick one or combine):

- **SessionStart hook**: On plugin load, delete runs older than 7 days
- **Prune at start of run**: Before creating a new output directory, delete all but the last 3 runs
- **`/clean` skill**: Manual cleanup command that lists runs with sizes and deletes selected ones
- **`.gitignore`**: At minimum, ensure `.solid_coder/` is gitignored (check if it is)

### Verified status (2026-03-12)

**Not implemented.** No cleanup step exists in either orchestrator. The project `.gitignore` does NOT include `.solid_coder/` or `.solid-coder-*`, so output directories would be tracked by git in user projects.

**Plan:**
1. Document that users should add `.solid_coder/` to `.gitignore`
2. Add a `/clean` skill that lists timestamped runs with sizes and allows selective deletion
3. Optionally add `--keep N` flag to orchestrators

## S-16: CRITICAL BUG — validate-findings.py passes findings for unknown files

**Impact**: Critical | **Effort**: Low | **Category**: Correctness (bug)

In `validate-findings.py` line 253-260:

```python
cr = changed_lookup.get(file_path)
if cr is None or cr is True:
    passing.append(finding)  # BUG: treats "not in lookup" same as "null ranges"
```

`changed_lookup.get(file_path)` returns `None` for BOTH:
1. File has `null` changed_ranges (entire file is new) — correct to pass
2. File not in review-input at all — should be REJECTED

If a review agent reports findings in a file that wasn't in the review-input (hallucination or path mismatch), those findings pass through unfiltered.

**Fix**: Distinguish the two cases:
```python
if file_path not in changed_lookup:
    continue  # file not in review-input, reject
cr = changed_lookup[file_path]
if cr is None or cr is True:
    passing.append(finding)  # null = entire file new
```

---

## S-18: `file_path` vs `file` inconsistency across schemas

**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Category**: Data contracts

- `prepare-review-input/output.schema.json`: uses `"file_path"`
- `SRP/review/output.schema.json`: uses `"file"`
- `validate-findings/file-output.schema.json`: uses `"file"`
- `synthesize-fixes/plan.schema.json`: uses `"file"`

The prepare agent writes `file_path`, the review agent reads it and outputs `file`. This works because the LLM adapts, but it's a latent bug — a stricter schema validator or a different LLM might fail.

**Fix**: Standardize on one name (`file_path` is more explicit). Update all schemas and all skills that reference the field.

### Verified status (2026-03-12)

**Not implemented — inconsistency confirmed.** Full inventory:

**Uses `file_path`:** `prepare-review-input/output.schema.json` (line 23), `prepare-changes.py` (line 150)

**Uses `file`:** All 5 review schemas (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, SwiftUI), all 5 fix schemas, `validate-findings/file-output.schema.json` (line 8), `synthesize-fixes/plan.schema.json` (line 8)

**Bridge code:** `validate-findings.py` reads `file_path` from review-input (line 103) and `file` from review output (line 162), outputs `file` (line 233). Works because the Python script manually maps between conventions.

**Plan:** Standardize on `file_path` everywhere (more descriptive). Update all 13 schema files + Python scripts.

---

## S-21: No tests for `prepare-changes.py`

**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Category**: Test coverage

`validate-findings.py` has 28 tests. `generate-report.py` has 24 tests. `prepare-changes.py` has **zero**. It's the entry point for all diff parsing — the most critical deterministic script.

Missing test scenarios:
- Empty git repo
- No changes (clean tree)
- Staged vs unstaged vs untracked
- Renamed files
- Binary files
- Files with special characters in names
- Hunk regex edge cases

### Verified status (2026-03-12)

**Not implemented — confirmed.** No test file exists for `prepare-changes.py`. Six other scripts DO have tests: `discover-principles`, `generate-report`, `load-reference`, `parse-frontmatter`, `check-severity`, `validate-findings`.

**Plan:** Create `skills/prepare-review-input/scripts/tests/test_prepare_changes.py` following existing test pattern. Key test cases: `parse_diff()` with various unified diff formats, `_coalesce()` with adjacent/non-adjacent ranges, `extract_imports()` with Swift imports, end-to-end `build_output()` (mock git commands), edge cases (empty diff, binary files, renamed files).

## S-22: Missing JSON error handling in Python scripts

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Category**: Robustness

`validate-findings.py` `load_json()` doesn't catch `json.JSONDecodeError`. Malformed JSON from a failed review agent causes an unhandled traceback instead of a clear error message.

Same applies to `generate-report.py`.

**Fix**: Wrap `json.load()` calls with try/except, print the file path and error, exit with code 1.

### Verified status (2026-03-12)

**Not implemented.** Four scripts have bare `json.load()`/`json.loads()` with no error handling:
1. `skills/validate-findings/scripts/validate-findings.py` — `load_json()` at line 35-37
2. `skills/validate-findings/scripts/check-severity.py` — line 44
3. `skills/generate-report/scripts/generate-report.py` — line 211
4. `skills/discover-principles/scripts/discover-principles.py` — line 195

Malformed JSON produces unhandled `json.JSONDecodeError` traceback instead of clean error.

**Plan:** Add try/except `json.JSONDecodeError` to each, print file path + error, `sys.exit(1)`.

---

## S-23: README.md is 2 lines with a typo

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Category**: Documentation

Current README:
```
# solid-coder
Claude Code plugging that contains convenient skills/workflows for Reviewing/refactoring/coding using solid principles
```

- "plugging" → "plugin"
- Doesn't list the 3 user-facing skills (`/review`, `/refactor`, `/code`)
- Doesn't mention the 3 implemented principles (SRP, OCP, LSP)
- Doesn't describe the pipeline architecture or how to install

**Fix**: Rewrite README to cover: what it does, how to install, how to use, what principles are implemented.

### Verified status (2026-03-12)

**Not implemented.** README is still 2 lines with "plugging" typo. No install, usage, skills listing, or architecture overview.

## S-30: SwiftUI SUI-2 (state width) and SUI-3 (responsibility mixing) — validate SOLID coverage

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Category**: Metric design | **Status**: Validate

SwiftUI rule was initially designed with three metrics: SUI-1 (body complexity), SUI-2 (state width/cohesion), and SUI-3 (responsibility mixing). SUI-2 and SUI-3 were removed because they overlap with SRP (cohesion groups, verb count) and OCP (sealed points).

**Hypothesis:** SRP and OCP will catch state proliferation and mixed responsibilities in SwiftUI views.

**Risk:** SRP's cohesion analysis works on method-variable relationships. In a SwiftUI view, all `@State` properties feed into `body` (one computed property), so SRP may see 1 cohesion group even when state properties serve 3 unrelated concerns. If SRP consistently misses this, SUI-2 should be re-added.

**Validation plan:**
1. Run SRP on 3-5 SwiftUI views with known state proliferation (8+ state props, 2+ concerns)
2. Run SRP on 3-5 SwiftUI views with inline business logic (formatting, data fetching)
3. Run OCP on views with `APIClient.shared` or singleton usage
4. If SRP/OCP flag >= 80% of cases correctly → keep SUI-1 only
5. If SRP/OCP miss > 50% → re-add SUI-2 and/or SUI-3

## S-35: Pre-commit hook for frontmatter validation

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Category**: Enforcement

**Status**: Pending — depends on S-33

Create `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` that runs `python scripts/registry.py --validate`. Blocks commits if any `Shared/` file is missing frontmatter. Three enforcement gates:

1. **Gate 1 — CC skill** (creation time) — DRY check + frontmatter prefill in `/code` skill
2. **Gate 2 — Pre-commit hook** (human-created files) — blocks commit
3. **Gate 3 — PR check** (CI) — same script, nothing merges without it

---

## S-37: Style rules separate pipeline — review-only, no fix generation

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Category**: Architecture

**Status**: Pending

Naming conventions, function smells, general code style do not fit the existing rule mechanics. No deterministic fix, no cross-principle synthesis. Feeding them into synthesize adds noise.

### Proposed structure

```
references/style/
  naming-conventions/
    rule.md              ← metrics + severity (MINOR only)
    review/
      instructions.md
      output.schema.json
    # NO fix/ folder — absence is the signal
    # NO refactoring.md
```

### Frontmatter flag

```yaml
---
name: naming-conventions
tier: style
severity-max: minor
synthesize: false    # explicit signal — skip fix generation
---
```

### Separate output contract

```json
{
  "solid_findings": [...],    // → synthesize → implement pipeline
  "style_findings": [...]     // → report only, no fix generation
}
```

`generate-report-agent` renders style findings as a separate section — observations, not actionable violations.

### Future style rules (planned)

- Naming conventions
- Function length / smells
- SwiftUI-specific style
- Concurrency patterns
- GCD usage guidelines

### Verified status (2026-03-12)

**Not implemented.** No concept of review-only rules exists anywhere:
- No `rule.md` frontmatter has `synthesize: false`, `fix: false`, or `review-only: true`
- `discover-principles.py` doesn't parse any such field
- `synthesize-fixes/SKILL.md` processes ALL non-COMPLIANT principles — no exclusion
- `generate-report.py` treats all findings uniformly — no fixable vs report-only distinction

**Plan:**
1. Add `fixable: false` (or `synthesize: false`) field to `rule.md` frontmatter for style rules
2. Update `discover-principles.py` to expose this field
3. In `synthesize-fixes/SKILL.md` Phase 1.4, exclude non-fixable principles
4. In `generate-report/SKILL.md`, render non-fixable findings as separate "observations" section
5. In `refactor/SKILL.md` Phase 4.6, only count fixable findings for `MINOR_ONLY` vs `HAS_SEVERE`

## S-39: Skip empty plans — don't synthesize or implement when no changes needed

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Category**: Pipeline efficiency

### Problem

The synthesizer writes plan files for every reviewed file, even when there are no actionable findings. The refactor orchestrator (Phase 7) then spawns implement agents for these empty plans, wasting agent invocations.

### Fix

Two levels:

1. **Synthesizer**: Do not write a `.plan.json` file if there are zero suggestions or zero `to_do` items for a file. No file = no implement agent spawned.
2. **Orchestrator fallback**: Before spawning an implement agent, check if the plan has any actions. Skip if empty.

Level 1 is preferred — it's cleaner to not produce empty artifacts than to filter them downstream.

## S-40: `solid-spec` frontmatter field — link types to requirement specs

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Category**: Future

**Status**: Future — validate current 4 fields first, add when spec workflow exists

---

## S-41: Local MCP server for `references/` — language-scoped principle loading

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Category**: Architecture

**Status**: Not implemented — would replace file-based `load-reference` with stdio MCP server; enables language namespacing (`principle://swift/SRP/rule`), server-side tag filtering, and partial section loading without reading whole files
